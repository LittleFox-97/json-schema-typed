# JSON Schema Spec Definitions

Consistent JSON definitions to help library authors implement JSON Schema
validators with bundled documentation.

All the definitions in this directly adhere to the TypeScript types found in
[types.ts](https://github.com/jrylan/json-schema-typed/blob/main/.src/types.ts).

Be cautious that if you use **any** of the definitions provided here, your
library must be compatible with the
[BSD-2-Clause license](https://github.com/jrylan/json-schema-typed/blob/main/dist/spec_definitions/LICENSE.md)
to be fully compliant with the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) licensing.
