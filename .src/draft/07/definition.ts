        This keyword is reserved for comments from schema authors to readers or

        Implementations MUST NOT present this string to end users. Tools for
        editing schemas SHOULD support displaying and editing this keyword.

        The value of this keyword MAY be used in debug or error output which is
        intended for developers making use of schemas. Schema vocabularies 
        SHOULD allow \`comment\` within any object containing vocabulary 
        keywords.

        Implementations MAY assume \`comment\` is allowed unless the vocabulary
        specifically forbids it. Vocabularies MUST NOT specify any effect of
        \`comment\` beyond what is described in this specification. Tools that
        translate other media types or programming languages to and from
        \`application/schema+json\` MAY choose to convert that media type or
        programming language's native comments to or from \`comment\` values.

        The behavior of such translation when both native comments and 
        \`comment\` properties are present is implementation-dependent. 
        Implementations SHOULD treat \`comment\` identically to an unknown 
        extension keyword.

        They MAY strip \`comment\` values at any point during processing. In
        particular, this allows for shortening schemas when the size of deployed
        schemas is a concern. Implementations MUST NOT take any other action 
        based on the presence, absence, or contents of \`comment\` properties.
      `,

    $id: {
      description: desc`
        The \`$id\` keyword defines a URI for the schema, and the base URI that 
        other URI references within the schema are resolved against. A 
        subschema's \`$id\` is resolved against the base URI of its parent 
        schema. If no parent sets an explicit base with \`$id\`, the base URI is
        that of the entire document, as determined per 
        [RFC 3986 section 5][RFC3986].

        If present, the value for this keyword MUST be a string, and MUST 
        represent a valid [URI-reference][RFC3986]. This value SHOULD be 
        normalized, and SHOULD NOT be an empty fragment \`#\` or an empty string.

    $ref: {
      description: desc`
        The \`$ref\` keyword is used to reference a schema, and provides the 
        ability to validate recursive structures through self-reference.

        An object schema with a \`$ref\` property MUST be interpreted as a 
        \`$ref\` reference. The value of the \`$ref\` property MUST be a URI 
        Reference. Resolved against the current URI base, it identifies the URI 
        of a schema to use. All other properties in a \`$ref\` object MUST be
        ignored.

        The URI is not a network locator, only an identifier. A schema need not 
        be downloadable from the address if it is a network-addressable URL, and
        implementations SHOULD NOT assume they should perform a network 
        operation when they encounter a network-addressable URI.

        A schema MUST NOT be run into an infinite loop against a schema. For
        example, if two schemas \`"#alice"\` and \`"#bob"\` both have an 
        \`allOf\` property that refers to the other, a naive validator might get 
        stuck in an infinite recursive loop trying to validate the instance. 
        Schemas SHOULD NOT make use of infinite recursive nesting like this; the
        behavior is undefined.

    $schema: {
      description: desc`
        The \`$schema\` keyword is both used as a JSON Schema version identifier 
        and the location of a resource which is itself a JSON Schema, which 
        describes any schema written for this particular version.

        The value of this keyword MUST be a [URI][RFC3986] (containing a scheme)
        and this URI MUST be normalized. The current schema MUST be valid 
        against the meta-schema identified by this URI.

        If this URI identifies a retrievable resource, that resource SHOULD be 
        of media type \`application/schema+json\`.

        The \`$schema\` keyword SHOULD be used in a root schema. It MUST NOT 
        appear in subschemas.

        Values for this property are defined in other documents and by other
        parties. JSON Schema implementations SHOULD implement support for 
        current and previous published drafts of JSON Schema vocabularies as 
        deemed reasonable.

        The value of \`additionalItems\` MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

        This keyword determines how child instances validate for arrays, and 
        does not directly validate the immediate instance itself.

        If \`items\` is an array of schemas, validation succeeds if every 
        instance element at a position greater than the size of \`items\` 
        validates against \`additionalItems\`.

        Otherwise, \`additionalItems\` MUST be ignored, as the \`items\` schema
        (possibly the default value of an empty schema) is applied to all 
        elements.

        The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean.

        If this keyword has boolean value \`false\`, the instance validates
        successfully. If it has boolean value \`true\`, the instance validates
        successfully if all of its elements are unique.

        Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as a value of \`false\`.

    writeOnly: {
      default: false,
      description: desc`
        The value of this keyword MUST be a boolean. When multiple occurrences 
        of this keyword is applicable to a single sub-instance, the resulting 
        value MUST be \`true\` if any occurrence specifies a \`true\` value, and 
        MUST be \`false\` otherwise.

        If \`writeOnly\` has a value of boolean \`true\`, it indicates that the 
        value is never present when the instance is retrieved from the owning 
        authority. It can be present when sent to the owning authority to update 
        or create the document (or the resource it represents), but it will not 
        be included in any updated or newly created version of the instance.

        An instance document that is marked as \`writeOnly\` for the entire 
        document MAY be returned as a blank document of some sort, or MAY 
        produce an error upon retrieval, or have the retrieval request ignored, 
        at the authority's discretion.

        For example, \`writeOnly\` would be used to mark a password input field.

        These keywords can be used to assist in user interface instance 
        generation. In particular, an application MAY choose to use a widget 
        that hides input values as they are typed for write-only fields.
